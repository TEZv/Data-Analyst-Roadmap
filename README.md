## 🤖 **Module 4: ML for Humans**  
### No-BS Theory  
- Linear Regression:  
  - "It's just y=mx+b from school... but with matrices 🧮"  
  - Cost Function → "Penalty for wrong predictions ❌"  
  - Gradient Descent → "Rolling down a hill to find the best slope 🏔️"  
- Logistic Regression:  
  - "When your outcome is yes/no → Use sigmoid magic 🎲"  

### Practical  
- **Task 1**: Manually calculate slope for 5 data points (pen/paper allowed!)  
- **Task 2**: Predict exam pass/fail using [Student Performance Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/student-performance)  

---

## 📉 **Module 5: Business Analytics**  
### Real-World Skills  
- A/B Testing → "Is red button better than blue? 🟥🟦"  
- **Metrics Mastery**:  
  - ROI → "Money earned ÷ money spent 💵"  
  - CTR → "How many clicked your cat meme 🐈⬛"  

### Practical  
- **Project**: Optimize [Google Merchandise Store](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6367342)  
  - Task: Increase sales by 10% using only 3 dashboard changes  
  - Present findings as a 3-panel comic strip 🎨  

---

## 🛠️ **Module 6: Git & Workflow**  
### Survival Skills  
- `git commit -m "Fixed everything 🔧"` → (Never do this!)  
- **Golden Rules**:  
  - Commit often → "Like saving a video game 🎮"  
  - Write meaningful messages → "No 'stuff' or 'things'"  

### Practical  
- **Task**: Create GitHub repo with your Titanic analysis → Get 3 stars ⭐ from friends

## 🎯 **Final Project**  
**Build a Portfolio Piece**:  
1. **Dataset**: [COVID-19 Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)  
2. **Requirements**:  
   - 1 SQL query with JOIN  
   - 1 Python visualization  
   - 1 Business recommendation ("If I were CEO...")  
3. **Presentation**: Explain to a rubber duck 🦆 (video optional!)
